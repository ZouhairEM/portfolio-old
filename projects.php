                <p>This is my venture in programming 3D using only Javascript. It's a data visualization of real exoplanets currently confirmed by NASA, using their publically made available dataset. It was a lot of fun and hard work building this entire star systems project.
                    <p>
                        <p>It was programmed in WebGL using Three.JS. It's probably the project I'm most proud of.</p>

                For an assignment that’s about capturing what makes you, you, in a digital fashion, I wanted to create something that’s been breathed life into, while giving the viewer a look into its entire process.
                <p>
                    <p>
                        I'd say what makes me, me, is my playful approach to things. Which is why I chose to stylize myself in an anime-like way. I drew myself and animated it using Javascript.

                <p>This assignment was about developing and installing an IT driven installation that would act as a reception for a building of the company DAF. The task was given to us by them because of their inability to hire a live receptionist due to budgetary reasons. DAF had felt the need for such an installation because the lack of a real receptionist for one of their buildings went as far as to affect business deals based on bad experiences by their clients, when they wouldn't be received properly. Our group was contacted to come up with a solution that could solve this problem.
                    <p>

                        What I, along with 5 others that had formed a group, ended up doing was create a conceptual project backed with a prototype for a "Smartdesk", that would act as an intermediary via a user-friendly interface between a client to DAF and a real receptionist that would be located at different buildings, other than where the Smartdesk would be built.</p>

                <p>This is my very first work with Javascript. You could consider it a prelude to the bigger, and in 3d, 'Project: Exoplanets'. It's a 2d interactive visualisation of the solar system tweaked with 'what if' scenarios such as when the sun would suddenly disappear from orbit or turn into a black hole. You can click on each planet and sun as well to read their descriptions.

                    <p>I used my passion for space as the direction of what I would make. The project got me a 9/10 from my teacher for visualising how I had wanted it made, and seeing that done until completion. I had a lot of fun working on it, so I had continued on it, starting from scratch, to produce what would eventually be 'Project: Exoplanets.'</p>

                <p>"Een veel beter plan" (or "A much better plan") is a story conceived, written and hosted on several platforms (a website and via epub) that's to do with climate change and, more specifically, climate change denial. It's a narrative that can end in three different ways, based on a quiz you, as the reader, can take.</p>
                <p>The assignment was about creating a cross-media story based on a plot that can affect and speak to everyone. So I thought in terms of giant problems that affect everyone's health, and everybody's future health as well: climate change.</p>
                <p>
                    A big component to the assignment was to build a community around the story. So, I had come up with a debate community, where one could challenge or nominate prominent and active users/readers of the story. It's all conceptual, it's not realised into its technical possibilities as that was not the point, so you'll find pictures and descriptions of this "community" instead.

                <p>Creating a concept and prototype for <i>Het Gelders Orkest</i> is the assignment I'm currently working on. It's a classical music playing orchestra that has asked us to think of ways that would make classical music be more appealing to a younger audience, using today's technology.</p>
                <p>Again as a group effort, we came up with the idea of organising big and thought out study sessions, where the music of the orchestra would be introduced. This is the big project in semester 4 that we have to back up with research, interviews and user tests to see if something like this conceptual project could result in the way we aspire it to.</p>
                <p>Further details and visuals are coming soon...</p>

                <p>The STRP festival had asked us to come up with ways that would enhance their online experience, that'd make their website more appealing to those who hadn't come to earlier editions of their festivals, and those who had.</p>
                <p>I thought of a way to make ordering tickets based on what you might want to visit at the festival easier and more fun to do. The result is like a social medium platform in that you can take online sneak peaks at what the STRP festival has to offer, then "like" whatever you see, and order which expositions you chose for you to be able to access, come the next edition of the festival.

                <p>A young rapper by the stage name of Meester Alex had asked us to help him grow professionally and come up with a concept and everything that would be related to that, to help further his new career.</p>
                <p>
                    What we ended up doing was thinking of tones of voices, visuals, creating posters, promos, media activities: all in the hope of giving Meester Alex that much desired professional boost. We had to think wisely about font choices, colours, footage. The whole thing.
